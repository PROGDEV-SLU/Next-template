# Template for PROGDEV new projects in Next.js (delete this code after start)

To use this template as a new next project, use the command:

```
npx create-react-app --example https://github.com/PROGDEV-SLU/Next-template <your-name-app>
```

Next step is link the new project with a git repository created in the github web.

When the git repository is created, copy the link which will be like this:

```
**https://github.com/PROGDEV-SLU/<repository-name>.git**
```

Use the link copied in the next command:

```
git remote add origin <link>
```

Last step would be use the next command to upload the new configuration:

```
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```
